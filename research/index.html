  <p>My primary research interest is the provable security analysis of symmetric-key cryptographic modes using combinatorial techniques. My doctoral research focused on provable security against a classical adversary. At Inria, I started exploring the exciting new field of provable security against a quantum adversary, as part of the ERC project <a href="https://project.inria.fr/quasymodo/" target=_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUASYModo</a>. At present I am studying proof frameworks for adapting classical counting techniques in post-quantum security proofs.</p>
