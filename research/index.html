  <p>My primary research interest is the provable security analysis of symmetric-key cryptographic modes using combinatorial techniques. My doctoral research focused on the provable security against a classical adversary. At present, I'm exploring the exciting new field of provable security against a quantum adversary, as part of the ERC project <a href="https://project.inria.fr/quasymodo/" target=_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUASYModo</a>.</p>
