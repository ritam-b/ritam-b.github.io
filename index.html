	<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL working on Classical and Post-Quantum Symmetric-Key Cryptography.</p>
	<p>I completed my PhD in Computer Science from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in December 2019. In October 2022 I joined the LASEC lab at EPFL as a post-doc. Before that, I was on an SRP contract at Inria, Paris, as part of the COSMIQ Team; this was a continuation of the post-doc position in the same team I joined in March 2020. Earlier I've been a Research Associate at the University of Luxembourg, as part of the SnT group.</p>
	<p>I always look forward to interacting with motivated students and young researchers. If you have something on your mind that you think might interest me, feel free to drop me a mail.</p>
