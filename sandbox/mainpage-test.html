	<p>Hi there, I'm Ritam Bhaumik, a postdoctoral researcher in Classical and Post-Quantum Symmetric-Key Cryptography.</p>
	<p>I completed my PhD in Computer Science from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in December 2019. As of February 2022, I am on an SRP contract at INRIA, Paris, as part of the COSMIQ Team. This is a continuation of the post-doc position I joined in March 2020. Earlier I've been a Research Associate at the University of Luxembourg, as part of the SnT group.</p>
	<p>I always look forward to interacting with motivated students and young researchers. If you have something on your mind that you think might interest me, feel free to drop me a mail.</p>
